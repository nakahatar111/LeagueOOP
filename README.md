You should report the tight bound runtime complexity of your code, explain how the code works, and reveal why the runtime complexity is what it is (for example, which aspects of the algorithm, code, and data structures contribute to the runtime complexity?

T = Number of Teams

P = Number of Players

I = Length of InputFile

V = Number of Buckets

Y = Number of Year Nodes

#Complexity of Graph-

Run-Time Complexity- O(P^2*V*Y)


#Case 1-
Run-Time Complexity- O(I) 

How the Code Works- Loops through every Line and prints 

Analysis of Runtime Complexity- Every Print is O(1) and you do that for every line which is the length of the input file


#Case 2a-

Run-Time Complexity- O(T)

How the Code Works- It prints the teams that the player has played on.

Run-Time Complexity- O(T)
